<span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:85%;">Season's Greetings!  This year, I received a nice gift to complete 2009: the game I recently completed, <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802585503d8">Henway</a>, was approved and published on the Indie Games area of Xbox LIVE Marketplace.<br /><br /><a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802585503d8"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 146px; height: 200px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Ra2ABd_qklc/SzUVINGZIoI/AAAAAAAABA4/vOiy4uf_sy4/s200/Henway.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5419260957309870722" /></a>Henway: <i>The goal is to cross the road without being killed; hence this game is based on real life</i>.<br /><br /><br />During playtest and review, the feedback received on the <a href="http://creators.xna.com">XNA Creators Club</a> was really positive and there were plenty of great ideas posted by fellow creators on the site.<br /><br />Note: creators must have a <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/membership">Premium Membership</a> before they can playtest and review Indie Games.<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of features and updates that could potentially be added in a future release:<ul><li>add more vehicles: trucks, buses, cyclists, motorcycles, tractors, emergency<li>add variety of squelching noises when the chicken gets run down<li>pause game when batteries removed from controller<li>use Xbox button images for quit and error popups
<li>add exhaust particles for some of the vehicles<li>disable sign in guide when saving<li>disable the continue option</ul></span>
