In 2012, as in previous years, there has been much speculation over the future of XNA; Microsoft has not announced any further development since the news: <a href="http://www.mobiletechworld.com/2011/09/19/no-xna-support-for-metro-applications-in-windows-8/">No XNA support</a> for Metro applications in Windows 8.
<br /><br />
However, many people believe that XNA may not be <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/xna-dead-long-live-xna">dead</a> because of the MonoGame open source project:
<br />
<i>
<a href="http://monogame.codeplex.com">MonoGame</a> is an open source implementation of the Microsoft XNA 4 Framework.  The goal is to allow XNA developers port their games to Windows 8 Metro as well as iOS, Android, Mac OS X and Linux; PlayStation Mobile development is currently in progress.
</i>
<br /><br />
Also, as an alternative to XNA that is gaining momentum is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(game_engine)">Unity 3D</a> game engine: many developers leveraging their C# game development experience to target PC, Mac and Linux with the potential of iOS, Android, Xbox 360 and PS3.
<br /><br />
There have also been an increasing number of Indie gaming distribution channels external to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live_Indie_Games">XBLIG</a>, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Fish_Games">Big Fish Games</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desura">Desura</a>, <a href="http://www.indiecity.com">Indie City</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)">Steam</a>.  While some of these platforms do host games written in XNA to target PC, the increased revenue generated from marketplaces such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS)">App Store</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play">Google Play</a> have prompted many developers to target iOS / Android directly.
<br /><br />
Therefore, the options available to independent game developers continue to grow and the outlook positive despite any future announcements of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA">XNA</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live_Indie_Games">XBLIG</a>, and the Microsoft Indie gaming scene.
