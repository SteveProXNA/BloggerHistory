It is correct that XNA is not supported for developing new style Metro applications in Windows 8.  But XNA remains fully supported and recommended for developing on Xbox and Windows Phone, not to mention for creating classic Windows applications (run on XP, Vista, Win7, and Win8 in classic mode).</i><br /><br />This report appears reminiscent to the XNA Game Studio 4.0 upgrade: <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/XNA-Game-Studio-4-0-Not-for-Zune-HD-Just-Windows-Xbox-360-and-Windows-Phone-7-136999.shtml">Not for Zune HD</a>.<br /><br />
Fortunately, there is some positive news for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_video_game_development">Independent game development</a>, especially now as digital distribution is becoming more prevalent in the games industry; various portals such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Fish_Games">Big Fish Games</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(software)">Steam</a> currently distribute the majority of Indie Games on PC and Mac.<br /><br />There are also independent games distribution websites, such as <a href="http://www.indiecity.com">IndieCity</a>, built to cater exclusively for Indie Games and <i><a href="http://www.develop-online.net/news/39298/New-indie-PC-platform-ends-discoverability-woes">end discoverability woes</a></i> for the community.<br /><br />Therefore, year 2012 appeals to the future of the Microsoft Indie gaming scene compared to alternative Indie Games distribution channels.</span>
