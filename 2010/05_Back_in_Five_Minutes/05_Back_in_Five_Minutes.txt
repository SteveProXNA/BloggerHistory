<span style="font-family:verdana;font-size:85%;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNA_(Microsoft)">XNA</a> is an exciting technology that allows independent game code to be developed and deployed to Windows, Xbox 360, and Zune.<br /><br />In 2009, I developed <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/games/media/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802585503d8">Henway</a> using XNA.  The game was approved and published on the Indie Games area of Xbox LIVE Marketplace.<br /><br />I also setup this <a href="http://steveproxna.blogspot.com/2009_08_01_archive.html">blog</a> to highlight some of the issues encountered during XNA game development, potential solutions to these issues, and to provide a general discussion on XNA.<br /><br />Here is a quick summary of some of the previous discussions on the site:

XNA is currently at version 3.1, which includes extensions for the <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-us/products/zunehd/default.htm">Zune HD</a> device.  However, version 4.0, scheduled for release later in 2010, will be compatible with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us">Visual Studio 2010</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework#.NET_Framework_4"> .NET Framework 4.0</a>.<br /><br />The big news from Microsoft however, is that <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/article/XNAGameStudio4.0FAQ">XNA 4.0</a> will target the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/cmpn/windowsphone7/default.mspx">Windows Phone 7</a> mobile device: provide full 3D graphics support and tight integration with Xbox LIVE Marketplace.<br /><br />Therefore, independent game code could now target the same <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com">marketplace</a> on both a <a href="http://www.xbox.com">gaming console</a> <i>and</i> <a href="http://www.windowsphone7.com">mobile device</a> within a single deployable code base.  <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/article/XNAGameStudio4.0FAQ">XNA 4.0</a> could create some very interesting opportunities, difficult to challenge by competitors in the gaming console and mobile device space.<br /><br />In conclusion, I would like to take a break from regular monthly blog posts to get more info on <a href="http://creators.xna.com/en-US/article/XNAGameStudio4.0FAQ">XNA 4.0</a> and begin working on the next game project.<br /><br />If I'm not back in five minutes, just wait longer <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span>
