C++ continues to be one of the preferred programming languages to develop professional applications and there is much information that documents C++ coding standards and how to write <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Specific-Improve-Programs-Designs/dp/0321334876">Effective C++</a>.
<br /><br />
However, it seems rare to find information that documents <b>how</b> to use the C++ language effectively;
<br />
That is: write C++ in such a way that minimizes cyclic, link and compile-time dependencies in C++.
<br /><br />
<u>Objective</u><br />
The objective of this post is to gain insight into the design of large, high-quality C++ software systems:
<br />
Create highly maintainable + testable software that uses increasing number of classes and lines of code.
<br /><br />

<u>Issues</u><br />
Poorly written C++ is difficult to understand + maintain.  As programs get large the following issues occur:
<br /><br />
<u>Cyclic Dependencies</u><br />
C++ components have tendency to get tangled up in each other which results in tightly physical coupling;
<br />
e.g. 2x components Rectangle and Window: Rectangle uses the Window and Window uses the Rectangle.
<table width="99%" border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="csharp" name="code">
&nbsp;// rectangle.h
&nbsp;#ifndef _INCLUDED_RECTANGLE
&nbsp;#define _INCLUDED_RECTANGLE

&nbsp;class Window;

&nbsp;class Rectangle
&nbsp;{
&nbsp;public:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rectangle(const Window& w);
&nbsp;};
&nbsp;#endif//_INCLUDED_RECTANGLE
</pre>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="csharp" name="code">
&nbsp;// window.h
&nbsp;#ifndef _INCLUDED_WINDOW
&nbsp;#define _INCLUDED_WINDOW

&nbsp;class Rectangle;

&nbsp;class Window
&nbsp;{
&nbsp;public:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Window(const Rectangle& r);
&nbsp;};
&nbsp;#endif//_INCLUDED_WINDOW
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
Now, both objects in the system must know about each other and #include the other object's header file.
<br />
Therefore, it is now not possible to compile, link, test and use one component without the using other!
<br /><br />
<u>Excessive Link-Time</u><br />
Cyclic dependencies make it necessary to link most dependent objects in order to test any of them at all.
<br />
Not only does this increase the executable size but can make the linking process unduly slow and painful!
<br /><br />
<u>Excessive Compile-Time</u><br />
When developing C++ programs, changes to a single header file can sometimes cause many translation units to recompile.  Why? Because the unnecessary inclusion of one header file by another is a common source of excessive coupling in C++.
<br /><br />
Ignoring compile-time dependencies can cause translation units to unnecessarily include header files.
<br />
This results in excessive compile-time dependencies which can reduce compilation speeds to a crawl!
<br /><br />
<u>Poor Physical Design</u><br />
This addresses design issues surrounding the physical entities of a system e.g. files, directories, libraries as well as organizational issues e.g. compile-time and link-time dependencies between physical entities.
<br /><br />
Good physical design implications often dictate the outcome of logical design decisions;
<br />
Therefore avoid logical design choices that would imply cyclic physical dependencies.
<br /><br />
<u>Testing Challenges</u><br />
Complex, well-designed software systems are built from layered parts that should have been tested thoroughly in isolation, then within a sequence partial subsystems, and as a fully integrated product.
<br /><br />
Therefore, it must be possible to decompose the entire system into its single units of functionality.
<br /><br />
<u>Summary</u><br />
Cyclic link-time dependencies among translation units can undermine understanding, testing, reusability.  Unnecessary or excessive compile-time dependencies increase compilation cost + destroy maintainability.
<br /><br />
Most C++ design books address only the <b>logical</b> design issues of project (classes, functions, inheritance).
<br /> 
However, quality of <b>physical</b> design often dictates improved outcome of many logical design decisions!
<br /><br />
<u>Techniques</u><br />
Two important techniques are discussed to mitigate cyclic dependencies in C++:

<td valign="top">&nbsp;Levelization</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;Techniques used to help reduce link-time dependencies</td>

<td valign="top">&nbsp;Insulation</td>
<td valign="top">&nbsp;Techniques used to minimize compile-time dependencies</td>

<br /><br />
<b>Levelization</b><br />
Levelization refers to the technique for reducing the link-time dependencies within a system.
<br />
Therefore, a system is levelizable when there are no cyclic dependencies, that is, <b>acyclic</b>.
<br /><br />
Link-time dependencies within a system establish the overall physical quality of a system;
<br />
e.g. understandability, maintainability, testability and reusability tied to a physical design.
<br /><br />
The following sections list techniques to help reduce link-time dependencies:
<br /><br />
<u>Escalation</u><br />
Refer back to the original example of 2x mutually dependent objects: Rectangle and Window.
<br />
Move the cyclic functionality into a higher level component; a technique called escalation.
<br /><br />
If peer components are dependent then it may be possible to escalate interdependent functionality;
<br />
Each component becomes static members in a higher-level component that depends on the original.
<table width="99%" border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="csharp" name="code">
&nbsp;// boxutil.h
&nbsp;class Rectangle;
&nbsp;class Window;
 
&nbsp;class BoxUtil
&nbsp;{
&nbsp;public:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static Rectangle toRectangle(const Window& w);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;static Window toWindow(const Rectangle& r);
&nbsp;};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br />
<u>Demotion</u><br />
Move the common functionality to lower levels of the physical hierarchy; a technique called demotion.
<br />
The new lower-level component is shared upon each of which the original component(s) depends.
<br /><br />
<u>Opaque Pointers</u><br />
In order to compile a function, the compiler needs to know the size and layout of the object it uses.
<br />
The compiler does this by #include the header file of the component containing the class definition.
<br /><br />
A function f uses a type T in size if compiling the body of f requires having first seen definition of T.
<br />
A function f uses a type T in name only if compiling f does not require having seen definition of T.
<br /><br />
A pointer is <b>opaque</b> if the type definition to which it points is not included in current translation unit.
<br />
This technique is sometimes referred to as the <i>Pointer to Implementation</i> idiom or the <b>Pimpl</b> idiom.
<table width="99%" border="1">
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<pre class="csharp" name="code">
&nbsp;// handle.h
&nbsp;class Foo;
 
&nbsp;class Handle
&nbsp;{
&nbsp;public:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handle(Foo* foo) : p_opaque(foo) {}
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foo* get() const { return p_opaque; }
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;void set(Foo* foo) { p_opaque = foo; }
 
&nbsp;private:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foo* p_opaque;
&nbsp;};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br />
<u>Dumb Data</u><br />
Any kind of information that an object holds but does not know how to interpret.
<br />
Such data must be used in the context of another object, at a higher level.
<br /><br />
E.g. rather than identifying objects by opaque pointer, we may use a short integer index instead.
However, an indexed approach does sacrifice type safety when compared to opaque pointers.
<br /><br />
<u>Redundancy</u><br />
This technique deliberately repeats code or data to avoid or remove unwanted physical dependencies.  
<br />
The additional coupling associated with some forms may outweigh the advantage gained from reuse.
<br /><br />
<u>Callbacks</u><br />
A function supplied by a client to allow lower-level component to take advantage of higher-level context.
Callbacks are useful in event-based programming to break dependencies between co-operating classes.
<br /><br />
However, when used inappropriately, callbacks can blur the responsibility of the lower-level objects.
<br />
This can result in unnecessary conceptual coupling that is difficult to understand, maintain + debug.
<br /><br />
<u>Factoring</u><br />
Extracting pockets of cohesive functionality: move them where they can be independently tested and reused; General technique for reducing the burden imposed by cyclicly dependent classes. Factoring:
<ul>
<li>A system into smaller components: more flexible yet more complex pieces to work</li>
<li>A concrete class into two classes containing higher and lower levels of functionality</li>
<li>An abstract base class into 2x classes: pure interface and partial implementation</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u>Escalating Encapsulation</u><br />
A common misconception is that each component must encapsulate all implementation details.
<br />
Instead we can hide a number of useful low-level classes behind single component: <b>Wrapper</b>.
<br />
Note: <i>Wrapper is a component-based implementation of the Façade design pattern.</i>
<br /><br />
<u>Summary</u><br />
By proactively engineering the system as a levelizable collection of components creates a hierarchy of modular abstractions that can be understood, tested, reused independently from the rest of the design.
