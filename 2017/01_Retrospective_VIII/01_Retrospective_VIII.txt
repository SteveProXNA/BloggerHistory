<u>2017 Objectives</u>
<br />
<table width="100%">
<tr><td valign="top">
<ul>
<li>Complete another Sega Master System video game that can run on real hardware</li>
<li>Integrate Git <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Submodules</a> similar to SVN Externals to scale out code across clients</li>
<li>Evaluate monetization plugins for MonoGame / XNA game projects e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction">Purchases</a></li>

2016, as every Virtual Reality evangelist will tell you, was the <a href="http://www.vrs.org.uk/news/2016-the-year-of-vr">year</a> of VR.  Game Engines such as Unity5 attempt to ease development transition to VR by adding <i>Virtual Reality Supported</i> checkbox to Settings.  However, repairing breakages from Unity4 to Unity5 game project upgrade is often challenging enough.
<br /><br />
<u>Homebrew</u><br />
Outside commercial game development, homebrew projects continue to be very popular: SMS Power hosted its annual Sega Master System coding <a href="http://www.smspower.org/Competitions/Coding-2016">competition</a> and attracted more than two dozen entries.
<br /><br />
This provided great opportunity to complete first Sega Master System video game 3D City using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z88DK">z88dk</a>.  Unfortunately, the game runs only in <a href="http://www.emutopia.com/index.php/downloads-emulators/item/298-sega-sg-1000-sc-3000/404-kega-fusion">emulator</a>.  R+D has begun to ensure games run on real hardware.
<br /><br />
<u>Summary</u><br />
Another busy year coding from Z80 assembler to C/C++ to C#/.NET certainly does keep life interesting!
